run:
first you need to run the <notification-server>
 via ./notification-server command in the root directory.
-> this will start a notification server written in go,
-> which is compiled only for linux machine.
-> then you should run an app via mvn spring-boot:run on your local machine
-> and waiting for the mock data will be initialized and saved,
-> and make sure that it's running correctly.
